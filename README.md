This repository contains our Mini electronics project "LED Flasher Security alarm using UJT"
<br><br>
The objective of this project is to design and develop a simple and low-cost laser
security alarm system using:
<br>
A Laser beam and LDR (Light Dependent Resistor) to detect obstruction.A
Unijunction Transistor (UJT) based relaxation oscillator to generate pulse signals.
An LED flasher circuit that visually indicates the breach using blinking light. A
buzzer to generate an audible alarm upon interruption of the laser beam.
<br><br>
<b>Key functional objectives:</b>
<ul>
  <li>Detect intrusion through laser beam interruption.</li>
<li>Convert light interruption into an electrical trigger using LDR and transistor logic.</li>
<li>Trigger a visual and audible alert system.</li>
<li>Ensure continuous flashing until manual reset, ensuring the user doesnâ€™t miss the
alarm.</li>
</ul>
